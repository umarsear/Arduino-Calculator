# Arduino-Calculator
Calculator implementation using 4x4 keypad, Arduino and 0.96 OLED display

The sketch is pretty simple and takes advantage of the Multiline OLED display. I have tried to mimic the behaviour of a regular calculator where the restult is the first operand of the next calculation to be made. 

There are bound to be some silly quirks, if you find something please share and help me improve. This project is intended to be a educational tool for budding electronics enthusiasts. 

You can buy the parts from eBay,
